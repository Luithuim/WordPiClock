If you have unplugged and replugged the clock and the time is still wrong follow these steps:


If the wrong time has been displayed, turn the clock on, wait at least two minutes, if more lights come on at that point, you may restart the clock. The issue was the wifi.



If the clock displays the wrong time beyond a few minutes, the pi will need to be removed, and checked for issues.

  1) To do so unplug the clock, and take the top plate off of the pi housing.

  2) Then carefully remove the pi, be wary of damaging the micro SD card, by bending it or the pi on the bottom plate of the housing.

  3) Plug the pi into a display, power it on, and check the logs.

  4) Any error messages can be displayed in the log folder and a google search of them will fix them.

If no errors are displayed reseat the cables once again, and give the clock a few minutes.

If all else fails, put the micro SD card into a new raspberry pi 4 model B and retry the clock.

If even this fails, refer to the total data loss file.
